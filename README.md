Android Phone Server

The Android Phone Server is a means for conecting your Android device remotely to other devices using a wifi socket. 
At the moment this allows you to check incoming messages, write sms messages, look at your contacts and more.
It is currently in development so please bear with me as changes are made.

A protocol list will be coming soon as well as other better documentation.
